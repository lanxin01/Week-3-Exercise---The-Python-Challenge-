Description

Python Challenge is a very interesting web breakthrough game. Players can solve problems and upgrade their level through Python programming. I think this game is a test of a comprehensive grasp of Python. For example, some levels require regular expressions, and some levels use simple webscraper. This knowledge relates to week 2.

Level 0 is about the knowledge of Python's basic numerical operations. Open an IDE, such as Python's own terminal, and you can calculate the result with one line of code.
Level 1 examines the knowledge of string encoding and for loops.
Level 2 is to find the fewest characters in the following large string of characters. Regular expressions extract characters, list counts, and conditional statements.
Level 3 uses Requests to request a web page and then uses a regular expression to extract the string, and then the for loop counts the number of occurrences of each character.
At the beginning of level 4, you need to use python skills to solve it. This level starts to add defects. You need to manually enter the value into the URL and press Enter. It will repeatedly insert new values for you to enter and replace them in cycles. Here we need to use Python to realize auto-fill, modify the URL and replace it with the new URL, and loop until the webpage can no longer be replaced. I use webscraper and regular expressions to solve it. Extract the value from each webpage and replace it with a new URL and then request the webpage, loop down, you can get the answer.

At this point, I feel more and more that Python is a very practical scripting language. Although learning Python is difficult, it requires a lot of practice to put what I have learned into practice.
